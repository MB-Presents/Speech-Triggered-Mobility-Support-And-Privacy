\section{Future Work}
This article highlights the problem of current voice assistants. With the presented concept the user can be guaranteed a better privacy. The last chapter presented some technologies for implementing this concept. It turned out that there is a wide range of technologies in the field of speech processing. As a next step, these technologies would need to be evaluated to make a technology selection. This selection can be used to determine what resources the private cloud needs to use these technologies. Furthermore, a cost model can be created based on the required resources and technologies. This can be used to conduct a new survey or interviews with potential target groups. The survey aims to show if the target groups are willing to pay additional costs for better privacy. Then you can start with a prototypical development of the voice assistant. In addition, a concept has to be developed with which apps can be checked for unwanted data transfer to third parties.
